Subject: Home Task Submission - AI-Powered Financial Intelligence Platform

Dear [Hiring Manager],

I'm excited to submit my response to the Financial Applications & AI Innovation home task.

Instead of a traditional document, I've created an interactive website to better demonstrate the user experience improvements central to my proposal:

🔗 https://your-deployed-site-url.com

The proposal focuses on an MCP-powered conversational AI assistant for NetSuite, with intelligent bill capture as a future integration phase.

Key highlights:
• Model Context Protocol integration for natural language financial queries
• 80% reduction in time-to-insight with democratized data access
• Comprehensive challenge mitigation strategies
• Practical implementation roadmap

Note: The website was built with AI assistance (Claude), demonstrating the kind of AI-powered productivity enhancement discussed in the proposal itself.

I look forward to discussing this solution further!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **Fonts not loading?** You need internet connection for Google Fonts
- **Animations not working?** Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- **Looks broken on mobile?** Test in Chrome/Safari mobile or use browser dev tools
- **Deployment failed?** Make sure all three files are in the root folder

---

**Good luck with your submission!** 🚀

This creative approach shows initiative, technical capability, and perfectly aligns with the "AI Innovation" theme of the assignment.
